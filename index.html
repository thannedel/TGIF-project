        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
          government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their
          public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
        <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend
          taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
          governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
          Government is doing.</p>
        <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
          effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
          public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
          become actively engaged in American government.</p>
        <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public
          feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                    <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                    <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                      opinion
                      dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on
                      absolutist
                      doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                      legislative
                      instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then
                      included
                      Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                      constitution
                      (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is
                      strongly
                      related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.</p>

                    <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom
                      of
                      the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
                      press
                      in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row
                      back
                      on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers,
                      Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                    <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is
                      often
                      linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
                      adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions
                      to the
                      eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence
                      in
                      1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in
                      1999).</p>

                    <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                      Information
                      Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
